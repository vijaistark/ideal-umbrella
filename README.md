Learn HTML and CSS
Welcome to my project repository where I document my journey of learning HTML and CSS. This project showcases the fundamental concepts and practical examples that I explored to build a solid foundation in web development. Inside, you'll find a series of HTML and CSS files demonstrating various techniques and features, from basic page structures to advanced styling methods. Feel free to explore, use, and improve upon the code. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated!

Feel free to adjust it according to your specific experiences and details of your learning process.
